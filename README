	Description:
	Puts the guess work back into typography. Sometimes mostly late at night 
	when you just can't think of what fonts to use. This minimal plugin
	solves that problem for you. It lets you cycle through a default list of
	fonts and you can also add your own.
	
	How to use it:

	To start it up use the following code:
	
		$('body').fontchanger(options);
		
	You can add you own fonts by putting an array where options is above.
		
		$('body').fontchanger(["Museo","anonymous"]);
	
	Use the left and right keys on your keyboard (a keyboard is required)
	to cycle through the fonts.
